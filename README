Chesshunter is a chess website started by Kyle Willmon and licensed under the
MIT License.

The goal of Chesshunter is to create an Open Source website for chess
enthusiasts. It is my belief that the chess community could greatly benefit
from the use and development of Free and Open Source Software.

To try it out in a virtualenv protected environment, simply install virtualenv
and do the following:

  virtualenv ENV
  source ENV/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python app.py

Then go in a web browser to http://localhost:8080/ and enjoy.

Patches and other help with development are always appreciated.
