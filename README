Chesshunter is a chess website started by Kyle Willmon and licensed under the
MIT License.

The goal of Chesshunter is to create an Open Source website for chess
enthusiasts. It is my belief that the chess community could greatly benefit
from the use and development of Free and Open Source Software.
